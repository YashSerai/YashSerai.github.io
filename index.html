        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Yash Serai, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University. My journey through academia and various projects has nurtured my passion for problem-solving, puzzles, chess, and video games. I thrive in environments where critical thinking, creativity, and meticulous attention to detail are valued.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time as a Software Developer Intern at Pakiza Textile in Dubai, UAE, I honed my skills in software development and debugging. I played a key role in enhancing system stability, contributing to a significant reduction in stock discrepancies through the implementation of a real-time inventory tracking system. My ability to author comprehensive documentation greatly reduced onboarding times for new team members, fostering a culture of knowledge sharing within the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have developed strong organizational skills, accountability, patience, multitasking abilities, time management, and critical thinking. These soft skills have been honed through my part-time experiences, such as serving at a VIP lounge and working in kitchen staff roles. These experiences have taught me to manage tasks efficiently, maintain high standards of service, and adapt quickly to dynamic environments. These skills complement my technical expertise, enabling me to manage projects effectively and deliver high-quality results.             
            </p>
            <p>I am actively seeking a role as a Software Developer where I can apply my extensive knowledge and passion for technology to create innovative and impactful solutions.</p>
        <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>
                My technical skills span a diverse range of programming languages including C, C++, R, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, SQL, Matlab, and Go. I am proficient in several frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, React.js, MongoDB, SQLlite, Unity, Android Studio, JUnit, and Django.
